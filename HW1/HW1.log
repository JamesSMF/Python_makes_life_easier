=============================================
Error in output generation. Your program is wrong on a test case. Specifically, mismatch at line 0
In output file, /Users/Andy/Desktop/sesh/Repos/gli38//HW1/my_output.txt, generated by your program, line is: 1 3 2 5 3 2 4 4 5 1 
In correct output file, line is: 1 3 2 1 3 4 4 2 5 5 


 There should be a test file (it's name is probably my_test.txt). That is the test case that failed.
Final score
