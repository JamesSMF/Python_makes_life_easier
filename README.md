# Python makes life easier

A repo for all kinds of programs which I don't know where should I deposit.
<br/>It's like a combination of a trash bin and a study database.

<b>Main programming languages will be python, java, and C </b>
<hr>Python is great, but not enough for a good programmer.

<br>
## This repo will also deposite all kinds of leetcode problems
