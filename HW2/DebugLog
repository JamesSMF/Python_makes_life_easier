Oct. 18th:

Got the general stucture done. Code are like a mess. Frequently got NullPointerException.

------------------------

Added if-else statement, and the exception was killed.

Start testing on bishop attacking.

The program passed the test for checking validity

Right now the main problem is the method "find" in class LinkedList

---------------------------

"find" problem solved. But still got nothing printed in out file.

---------------------------

out.flush() was added, and output problem has been solved.

The new problem lies in bishopAttack().

---------------------------

bishopAttack() fixed.

But there seem to be some new problems on checking validity.

Input check: pass
Link current test: pass

The problem seems to be if(target.next.next == null)
